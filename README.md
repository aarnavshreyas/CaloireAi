# calorieai

This project was bootstrapped with Expo and is set up for Expo Router and TypeScript.

## Note
The `app` directory (required for Expo Router) is missing and will be created in the next steps. This directory will contain all the route files and screens for your app.

## Next Steps
- Create the `app/` directory for routing and screens
- Add folders for `components/` and `lib/`
- Set up Supabase client
- Add placeholder screens for Auth, Onboarding, and Meals
- Install additional dependencies as needed
